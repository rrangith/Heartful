    "Remember, the only thing you can change in any given situation is the way you react to it. I hope you remember that when you face any crisis the day may throw at you",
    "There are times when we stop, we sit still. We listen and breezes from a whole other world begin to whisper.",
    "Breath is the power behind all things…. I breathe in and know that good things will happen.",
    "Within you, there is a stillness and a sanctuary to which you can retreat at any time and be yourself.",
    "Feelings come and go like clouds in a windy sky. Conscious breathing is my anchor.",
    "Simply let experience take place very freely, so that your open heart is suffused with the tenderness of true compassion.",
    "Don’t try to force anything. Let life be a deep let-go. God opens millions of flowers every day without forcing their buds.",
    "Set peace of mind as your highest goal, and organize your life around it.",
    "Many a calm river begins as a turbulent waterfall, yet none hurtles and foams all the way to the sea."
